# USB2Drive HID Access Modes

This example demonstrates a USB-to-CAN HID adapter in two interaction models: protocol-based and report-based communication. Separate project files allow side-by-side comparison of both HID access patterns.

## Requirements

- Docklight Scripting (HID communication mode)

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| usb_hid_demo_protocol_based.ptp | Docklight project file |
| usb_hid_demo_protocol_based_ptp.txt | Text export of project file |
| usb_hid_demo_protocol_based_with_alias.png | Screenshot |
| usb_hid_demo_report_based.png | Screenshot |
| usb_hid_demo_report_based.ptp | Docklight project file |
| usb_hid_demo_report_based_ptp.txt | Text export of project file |

## Getting Started

1. Open `usb_hid_demo_protocol_based.ptp` in Docklight Scripting for protocol-based HID access.
2. Alternatively, open `usb_hid_demo_report_based.ptp` for raw report-based HID access.
3. Press `F5` to start communication with the selected HID mode.
