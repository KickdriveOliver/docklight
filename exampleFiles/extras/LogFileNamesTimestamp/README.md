# Timestamped Log File Names

These scripts rotate log output into date/time-stamped files, with per-day and per-hour strategies included. Sample output logs are provided to illustrate naming conventions and rollover behavior.

## Requirements

- Docklight Scripting (script-based workflow)

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| logfile_2006_08_28_12H_asc.txt | Text export or notes |
| logfile_2006_08_28_12H_hex.txt | Text export or notes |
| logfile_2006_08_28_13H_asc.txt | Text export or notes |
| logfile_2006_08_28_13H_hex.txt | Text export or notes |
| One_LogFile_Per_Day.pts | Docklight Script |
| One_LogFile_Per_Day_pts.vbs | VBScript export of script |
| One_LogFile_Per_Hour.pts | Docklight Script |
| One_LogFile_Per_Hour_pts.vbs | VBScript export of script |

## Getting Started

1. Open `One_LogFile_Per_Day.pts` or `One_LogFile_Per_Hour.pts` in Docklight Scripting.
2. Run with `Shift+F5` and verify generated logfile naming in the output folder.
