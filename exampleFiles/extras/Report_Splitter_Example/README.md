# Report Splitter Example

This example splits long payloads into multiple transmission frames using script logic. It demonstrates framing control and chunked send behavior for constrained receivers.

## Requirements

- Docklight Scripting (script-based workflow)
- Docklight can be used for project-only runs where no script is required
