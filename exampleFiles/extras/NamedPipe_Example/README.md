# Named Pipe Example

This setup demonstrates communication over Windows Named Pipes using Docklight as client and a companion server executable. The NamedPipeServer subfolder includes full C++ source, Visual Studio project files, and prebuilt binaries.

## Requirements

- Docklight Scripting (network/HID/named-pipe examples are intended for Docklight Scripting)

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| NamedPipeServer/ | Subdirectory with additional examples |
| docklight_pipes_example_screenshot.png | Screenshot |
| testpipe.ptp | Docklight project file |
| testpipe_ptp.txt | Text export of project file |

## Getting Started

1. Open `testpipe.ptp` in Docklight Scripting.
2. Configure the interface parameters for your setup and press `F5` to start communication.
