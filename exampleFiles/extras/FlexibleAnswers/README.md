# Flexible Answers

This scripting example shows rotating and conditional responses using DL_OnSend() callbacks. A tester project is included so the behavior can be verified with two Docklight instances.

## Requirements

- Docklight Scripting (script-based workflow)
- Docklight can be used for project-only runs where no script is required
