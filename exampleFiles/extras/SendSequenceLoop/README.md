# Send Sequence Loop

This script continuously loops through configured send sequences with a configurable delay between each transmission. It is useful for burn-in and repeatability tests.

## Requirements

- Docklight Scripting (script-based workflow)
- Docklight can be used for project-only runs where no script is required

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| SendSequenceLoop.ptn | Project documentation (Notepad) |
| SendSequenceLoop.ptp | Docklight project file |
| SendSequenceLoop.pts | Docklight Script |
| SendSequenceLoop_ptn.txt | Text export of documentation |
| SendSequenceLoop_ptp.txt | Text export of project file |
| SendSequenceLoop_pts.vbs | VBScript export of script |

## Getting Started

1. Open `SendSequenceLoop.ptp` in Docklight Scripting.
2. Configure the interface parameters for your setup and press `F5` to start communication.
3. If you want the script-driven variant, open `SendSequenceLoop.pts` in Docklight Scripting and start it with `Shift+F5`.
